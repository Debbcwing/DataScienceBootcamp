    "## What is Statistical Inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical inference describes the process where conclusions about a population can be formed, based on certain statistics calculated from a sample of that population.\n",
    "\n",
    "It focuses around three major goals:\n",
    "   1. Estimation of unknown parameters of the statistical model\n",
    "   2. Select the best model for your data\n",
    "   3. Do predictions with your model\n",
    "\n",
    "And the two main approaches to statistical inference are:\n",
    "  - Likelihood inference\n",
    "  - Bayesian inference\n",
    "\n",
    "There are important statistical concepts that need to be understood in order to make statistical inference. The following concepts will be covered initially:    \n",
    "  - [Law of Large Numbers (LLN)](#Law-of-Large-Numbers-(LLN))     \n",
    "  - [Central Limit Theorem (CLT)](#Central-Limit-Theorem-(CLT))     \n",

    "# Central Limit Theorem (CLT) \n",
    "\n",
    "The central limit theorem is a key concept in probability theory. Did you ever wonder why you hear so much about normal distribution, but not other distributions?\n",
    "The answer is behind central limit theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theorem states that **the sampling distribution of the sample mean is at least approximately, normally distributed, regardless of the distribution of the underlying random sample**\n",
    "Again, it holds for variables that are independent and identically distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very powerful statement. Assume you will repeat certain experiment many times. At each step you will calculate mean value for this experiment. The distribution of this mean will always be approximately normal. **It doesn't matter what your underlying distribution is.**\n",
    "It implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions. Even when this distribution is complicated, or unknown.\n",

    "Everything in machine learning revolves around estimating parameters. You will often hear about weights or coefficients in neural networks. Those are the estimates.\n",

    "Now, let's make a distinction between an estimate and an estimator.\n",

    "**An Estimator:** is a statistic (arbitrary function of a random sample), used to extract information of a parameter from the random sample.\n",
    "It is expressed as a function of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An Estimate:** is the value of the evaluated estimator computed based on the data (realizations of the random sample)\n",
    "It is computed based on $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$\n",
    "and is usually denoted by $\\hat{\\theta}$ for a parameter $\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimator is a function, and an estimate is a value of this function. Usually we are interested in estimates that maximize certain function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training machine learning models is simply a process of finding the best estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of estimates: \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Point estimate: single value \n",
    "  * Interval estimate: defined by lower and upper limit\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, a confidence interval refers to the probability that a population parameter will fall between a set of values for a certain proportion of times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a 95% confidence interval for the standard normal distribution is the interval (-1.96, 1.96), since 95% of the area under the curve falls within this interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is illustrated in the image below. Remember that the standard normal distribution has \n",

    "mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. \n",

    "![](https://i.imgur.com/z2Ypxz3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the standard normal that we can see in the image above, we can use the `norm.ppf()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that `norm.ppf()` returns a value in standard deviations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the `norm.ppf()` function is the confidence interval we wish to find converted into decimal.    \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we must remember that the confidence interval is spread around the mean, which means that we must deduct half the unwanted area off each side:"
