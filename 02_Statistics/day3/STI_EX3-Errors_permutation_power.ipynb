Unfortunately, due to privacy protection laws, you are not able to get the exact weight of diabetes patients. You know, however, that normal distribution approximates well weight. The weight of healthy people follows ~ N(45,5), and the weight of diabetis patients follows ~ N(50, 5). With this information, you can make the conclusion on the null hypothesis.
